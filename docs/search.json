    "text": "About this site\n\nMy name is Sumrah Shakeel, and I hold a Bachelor’s in Business with a concentration in Business Analytics (Hons.) degree from George Mason University and an Associate’s in Business Administration from Northern Virginia Community College. My academic background and sincere interest in statistical analysis has motivated me to pursue my Master’s in Data Analytics Engineering, a program offered here at George Mason University. I strongly believe that this graduate program will help me in gaining a comprehensive understanding of advanced statistical methods which combined with my current skills, will further enable me to contribute meaningfully to the drug development for various diseases, which in turn will benefit the society. While being a part-time student at George Mason University and simultaneously working as a SAS Programmer at a Heptronik Corp, a biostatistical consulting organization, I made sure to work hard and give my best towards both, keeping up my grades as a student, and keeping up my performance as an employee. It did get demanding quite a few times, however, the end goal of helping humanity by giving it my best in the pharmaceutical industry with skills acquired both at college and at work, motivated me to keep going. As of now I work as a Programmer Analyst, in the data analytics department at PPD, one of the world’s leading CRO’s for a company in the pharmaceutical industry. Throughout my professional journey of three years, I have worked on clinical trials data of drug development related to cardiovascular, oncology, ophthalmology, rheumatology, and dermatology. The fact that I get to be involved in oncology studies of different types of cancers like skin, ovarian, liver, etc. and highligh infectious diseases fuels my passion and motivates me to stay focused and steadfast on my professional journey. The fact that decision-making in statistical science is evidence-based and that with the right skills and analytical understanding, it can be transformative to not just addressing societal challenges but also the federal government, the industry in general, and public health concerns, is very fascinating. I am eager to practically apply my skills to statistical methodologies and make a positive difference. The SEAL Award, which is the most prestigious award given to students by Northern Virginia Community College, is proof of my dedication towards service, engagement, academics and leadership. My academic background, and the genuine passion I have for statistical analysis, has fueled my desire to pursue this program and, more importantly, to apply this knowledge for the betterment of society. I can assure you that the skills acquired during my time as a graduate student of statistical science at George Mason University will be aptly utilized towards the commitment I have towards my passion of working for the greater good of humanity by working in the pharmaceutical industry and being a small part in the drug development cycle of diseases whose cures are still being researched. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to George Mason University’s legacy of academic excellence and societal engagement.\nMy technical skills include working with SAS, Python, SQL and R."
