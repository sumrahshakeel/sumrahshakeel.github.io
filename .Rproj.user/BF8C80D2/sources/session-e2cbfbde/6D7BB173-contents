About this site

```         
```

My name is Sumrah Shakeel, and I am a Programmer Analyst by profession and passion. I hold a Bachelor’s in Business with a concentration in Business Analytics (Hons.) degree from George Mason University and an Associate’s in Business Administration from Northern Virginia Community College. Some of the programming languages I am familiar with are SAS, R, Python and SQL. I also hold a Base SAS Certification.

The pursuit of knowledge never ends, hence, to further gain a a comprehensive understanding of advanced big data analytics, I am pursuing my Master's in Data Analytics Engineering from George Mason University and aiming to graduate in May 2026.

I come from 3+ years of professional experience in Clinical SAS Programming. The following are the positions I have held/am currently holding:

-   Programmer Analyst for the Data Analytics department at PPD, part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, one of the world’s leading CRO’s

-   SAS Programmer at Heptronik Corp, a biostatistical consulting organization

Since decision-making in data analytics is evidence-based and that with the right skills and analytical understanding, an individual is considered a good data analyst, this website should be able to give you a glimpse of my understanding.
